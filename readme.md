#Elevator Simulator

##Short story

The elevator in the building I live in have very strange behavior.
For example imagine if you are on the last floor and the elevator is on the floor under. You call it but at the same time someone in the elevator pushes the button for parter floor. First it will go to the parter and then will come back to the last floor to pick you. It will be more pratcical if it goes one floor up, pick people there and then bring all to parter.

So, I asked myself: how could you program elevator to work?

... and there comes this small app.
